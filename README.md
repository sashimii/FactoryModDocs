# FactoryMod YML -> HTML Conversion React SPA 0.0.1

A single page react application that converts the latest civcraftConfig.yml to an HTML site that is **relatively** more player-friendly.

Credits to the react-starterify starter pack, because I hate set up time.

## To Do:

* Design (Needs to look pretty)
* Search Box
* More defensive code

## Running this locally:


Install dependinces with: `npm install`

For Development: `gulp watch`
   * Browserify should boot up your default browser and go to the site at localhost:3000

For Build: `gulp build`

## FAQ

### Q: What the hell is this voodoo syntax?

Answer: A mixture of ES6 and JSX, which is usually used in React.js projects. We can has `const`s now! Too lazy to link each of those things so just google it.
