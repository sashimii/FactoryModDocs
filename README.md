# FactoryMod YML -> HTML Conversion React SPA 0.0.1

A single page react application that converts the latest civcraftConfig.yml to an HTML site that is **relatively** more player-friendly.

Credits to the react-starterify starter pack, because I hate set up time.

## To Do:

* Design (Needs to look pretty)
* Search Box
* More defensive code
